A towel is the most massively useful thing you can have as an interstellar hitchhiker. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moon of Jaglan Beta; You can lie on it brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so readily on the desert world of Kakrafoon: use it to sail a mini-raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat* wrap it around you head to ward of the noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal(a mind-bogling stupid animal that if you cant see it, it cant see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal,and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems clean enough.
But more importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has a towel with him, he will automaticaly assume that he is also in possesion of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit,etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will happily lend the hitchhiker any or a dozen other items that the hicthhiker might have 'lost'.
