**1 Area:** infinite.

*The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the word 'infinite'.*

> infinite:  Bigger than that, in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunnig size, real 'wow, that's big' time. Infinity is just so big by comparison bigness itself looks really quite small. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort is the of concept we're trying to get across here.

**2 Imports:** None.

*It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from.*

**3 Exports:** None.

*See imports*

**4 Population:** None.

*It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not everyone of them is inhabied. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all planets can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination*

**5 Monetary units:** None.

*In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altarian dollar has recently collapsed, the Flainian Pobble Bead is only exchangeadle for other Flainian Pobble Beads, And the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu was simple enought, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles along each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Ningis are not negotiable currency, because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination.*

**6 Art:** None.

*The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn't a mirror big enought - see point one.*
