**1 Area:** infinite.
*The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the word *'infinite'.*

> infinite:  Bigger than that, in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunnig size, real 'wow, that's big' time. Infinity is just so big by comparison bigness itself looks really quite small. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort is the of concept we're trying to get across here.

**2 Imports:** None.

*It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from.*

**3 Exports:** None.

*See imports*

**4 Population:** None.

*It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not everyone of them is inhabied. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all planets can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination*
