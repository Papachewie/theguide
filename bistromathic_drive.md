The Bistromathic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors.

Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed tha time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's moment in space, and that space was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depended on the observer's movement in restaurants.

The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. Ths will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or the number of people who subsequently join them after the show/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up. 

The secound non-absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known one of the most bizzar of concepts, a Recipriversexclusion, a number whose existence can only define as being anyhing other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arive. Recipriversexclusions now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field.

The third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill,the cost of each one, the number of people at the table, and what they are prepared to pay for.(The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenom in this field.)

Teh baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness, meanness, tiredness, emotionality or the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the following morning. They were never tested under labratory conditions, of course, because they never occured in labratories- not in reputable labs at least.

And so it was only with the advent of pocket computing that the startling truth became apparent, and it was this:

__*Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathmatical laws as any numbers written on any other peice of paper in any other parts of the Universe.*__

This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It completely revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died of heart failure that the science of maths was put back by years.

Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be understood. To begin with it had been to stark, too crazy, too much what the man on the street would have said, "Oh, yes, I could have told you that," about. Then some phrases like "Interactive Subjectivity Frameworks" were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it.
