Vogon Construter Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy - not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without  orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to inquiry, lost again, and finaly buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.

The best way to iritate a Vogon is to feed his gandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.
