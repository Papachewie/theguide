Far back in the mist of acient time, in the great and glorius days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax-free. 

Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small fury creatures from Alpha Centauri were really small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.

And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before - and thus was the Empire forged.
